List 3 major differences between #define and const:

Const is a C++ statement, #define is a macro that is effectively a
search-and-replace within the cpp file prior to compilation.

#define can be extended for use as a macros, which are expansions of C++ code
during preprocessing, const is interpreted strictly as a constant expression and
does not permit macro-style behavior.

const is interpreted within the C++ compiler, and as such behaves properly with
operator precedence, whereas #define expressions need further parenthetical
surrounds to prevent improper operator precedence error.
